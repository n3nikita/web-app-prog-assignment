### Objective:

This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript. You will create a dynamic web page that responds to user interactions, alters content, structure, and style, demonstrating fundamental concepts of DOM manipulation.



Assignment Details:



1. Create a Basic Web Page Layout

   - Develop an HTML page with the following elements:

     - A header with a title.

     - A navigation bar with at least three links (these can be dummy links).

     - A main content area with at least two sections or articles.

     - A sidebar with a list of items.

     - A footer with your name as the author.



2. Implement DOM Manipulation Using JavaScript

   - Add a script tag to your HTML page and implement the following functionalities:

   - Content Replacement: When a user clicks on an item in the sidebar, change the content of one of the sections in the main content area.

     - Style Alteration: Add a button that, when clicked, changes the colour scheme of the page (e.g., background colour, text colour).

     - Element Creation and Deletion: Allow the user to add new items to the sidebar list and remove existing items.

     - Event Handling: Display a pop-up message when a user hovers over the header.



3. Ensure User-Friendly Interface

   - The page should be easy to navigate.

   - Ensure that all JavaScript interactions are smooth and do not cause abrupt page reloads.



Submission Guidelines:

- Submit a link to the live version of your webpage.

- Ensure your code is well-commented to describe your logic.

- If any resources are used (like images or external scripts), please include references or sources.



Evaluation Criteria:

- Correct implementation of DOM manipulation techniques.

- Code readability and proper commenting.

- User interface and interaction design.
